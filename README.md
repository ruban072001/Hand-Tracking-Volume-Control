**Hand-Tracking Volume Control 🎛️**

This project allows users to control their system volume through hand gestures, using computer vision and hand tracking. By tracking the thumb and index finger, the application adjusts the system’s audio volume based on the distance between them, providing a touch-free interface for volume control.

**Features ✨**

**Real-time hand tracking** using MediaPipe.

**Volume control** based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.

**Smooth volume adjustment** with visual feedback (volume bar and percentage).

**Displays FPS** for monitoring performance.

**How It Works 🔍**

1.The webcam captures the video stream, and MediaPipe detects hand landmarks in real-time.

2.The distance between the thumb and index finger is measured.

3.This distance is mapped to a volume range using interpolation.

4.The system volume is adjusted dynamically using Pycaw.

5.The volume bar and percentage are updated on-screen to give real-time feedback.

**Technologies Used 🛠️**

**Python:** Core programming language.

**OpenCV:** For video capture and processing.

**MediaPipe:** For hand landmark detection.

**Pycaw:** To interact with the system’s audio interface.

**NumPy:** For interpolation of volume levels.


**Installation ⚙️**

**Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hand-Tracking-Volume-Control.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**
cd Hand-Tracking-Volume-Control

**Install dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

Here's a sample **requirements.txt:**
opencv-python,
mediapipe,
numpy,
pycaw,
comtypes.

**Run the project:**
python volume_control.py

**Usage 🎮**
1.Ensure your webcam is connected.

2.Run the project and use your thumb and index finger to control the volume.

3.Bring them close together to lower the volume, or move them apart to increase it.

4.Press q to exit the application.

**Future Improvements 🛠️**

1.Add gesture-based play/pause functionality.

2.Improve hand detection accuracy in low-light conditions.

3.Extend support to other media controls like mute and next/previous track.
