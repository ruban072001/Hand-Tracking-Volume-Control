# Hand-Tracking-Volume-Control
This project uses hand tracking to control system volume with gestures. Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pycaw, it detects the distance between thumb and index finger to adjust volume. Real-time feedback is provided via a volume bar, and FPS is displayed to monitor performance.
